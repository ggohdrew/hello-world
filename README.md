# hello-world
You know, growing up in a small town, laying awake at night and thinking to myself, "wow, repository, I'll be damned." That's what dreams are made of. 
I'm the size of a peanut, no bigger, and no smaller. I have a hard time breathing because my lungs contain bubblegum. That's of no use to the Russians, I'm sure, but the Canadians see me as their ticket to fame. I can't blame them, I'd do the same thing given such an extraordinary opportunity. Thanks for listening, that's all we need sometimes, ya know?
